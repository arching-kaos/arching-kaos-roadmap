# Arching Kaos Roadmap

> This is the README.md file of the Roadmap sub-project.

In `maps` folder you can find several maps (soon) about the Arching Kaos project.

The different maps are needed to keep the structure of the project comprehended.

## Version Specification

### Version 1
It was dedicated to the first part of development which was to put some basic infrastructure apart from topology to work on the project. The original goal of version 1 was to bring the concept and further explore where to go from there.

### Version 2
Fully decentralization and distribution of the project. In means that:

- anyone can run it (easy or hard)
- anyone can fork it
- anyone can understand it
- anyone can reimplement the basic concept
- anyone that wants can bridge/clone to other networks
- anyone that wants can expand it

## Whitepapers
In some ways we need to declare what is arching-kaos and what is not. There are currently two long text files that are describing both version 1 and 2 of the project.

Under docs folder in the arching-kaos repository you can find the version 1 of the documentation.

The second version is located in arching-kaos-infochain repository.

Transition from version 1 to 2 will be tracked in [arching-kaos-transition-roadmap](./maps/arching-kaos-transition-roadmap.md) file.
