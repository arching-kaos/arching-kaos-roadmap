### Development


###  

## General overview
Arching Kaos is a project that consists of communication ways, distributed filesystem and wants to be a decentralized overall protocol.

It is mainly used for a webradio.

### What I want to do?
I want to decentralize the current [radio station](https://radio.arching-kaos.com).
I am thinking to use PTK and/or ARCHINGKAOS for carrying messages.

### Proof of concept
Make on small application that demonstrates a 'news' type messages that integrates the [news repo](https://git.kaotisk-hund.com/01-NEWS/.git).
