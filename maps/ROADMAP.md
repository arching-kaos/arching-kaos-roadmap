## Brief description


## The Map ( 2022-01-12 )
> The reference "Arching Kaos" will be used while speaking for the project itself as a whole.

### Development
Parts in need are:

- [ ] - Static HTML5 page which loads the content we want

- [x] - Modules

###  

## General overview
Arching Kaos is a project that consists of communication ways, distributed filesystem and wants to be a decentralized overall protocol.

It is mainly used for a webradio.

### What I want to do? *DONE*
I want to decentralize the current [radio station](https://radio.arching-kaos.com).
I am thinking to use PTK and/or ARCHINGKAOS for carrying messages.

### Proof of concept
Make on small application that demonstrates a 'news' type messages that integrates the [news repo](https://git.kaotisk-hund.com/01-NEWS/.git).
